scope chain: used to resolve variables in js.
scope chain is lexiclly defined -> which scope chain will be looking at the code>
top of scope chain -> global scope ->window object in the  browser

Lexical Scoping : a function that is lexically within another function gets access to the scope of another function 

inner(child) function can access their parent function variables 


<script>

    var a ="hello guys"; //global varible

    function first(){               //parent functn- its execution context 
        var b ="how are you ";
        second();   //calling fnctn

            function second(){                  //child function that can access parent fnctn variables
                var c="how old are you?";
                console.log(a+b+c);
                three();

            }
    }               //parent execution context ends here 
    function three(){
        var d="i am a web deveoper";
        console.log(a+b+c+d);               //shows error cant access above function varibles because it is not in his environemnet or scope 
    }
    first();
    </script>
